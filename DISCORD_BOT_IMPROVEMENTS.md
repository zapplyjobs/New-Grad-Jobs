# Discord Bot Improvements - Session Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the improvements made to the enhanced-discord-bot.js for fixing emoji issues and implementing forum channel posting functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Emoji Display Issues
**Problem**: Emojis were appearing as text codes (e.g., "üìç") instead of actual emojis in Discord messages.

**Solution**:
- Removed company emojis from embed titles (as they can cause rendering issues)
- Moved company emojis to forum thread titles where Discord handles them better
- Ensured proper Unicode emoji rendering in field names

### 2. Enhanced Forum Channel Support
**Problem**: Jobs were being posted as messages in a single channel instead of as forum posts in categorized channels.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `postJobToForum()` function to:
  - Create forum threads with formatted titles: `[emoji] Job Title @ Company Name`
  - Apply forum tags automatically based on job characteristics
  - Set appropriate auto-archive duration (7 days)
  - Include company emojis in thread titles for better visual identification

### 3. Improved Job Categorization
**Problem**: Jobs needed to be routed to appropriate forum channels based on their category.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `getJobChannel()` function with better pattern matching:
  - Sales roles ‚Üí `#sales-jobs`
  - Marketing roles ‚Üí `#marketing-jobs`
  - Finance roles ‚Üí `#finance-jobs`
  - Healthcare roles ‚Üí `#healthcare-jobs`
  - Product Management ‚Üí `#product-jobs`
  - Supply Chain ‚Üí `#supply-chain-jobs`
  - Project Management ‚Üí `#project-management-jobs`
  - HR roles ‚Üí `#human-resources-jobs`
  - Tech/Engineering (default) ‚Üí `#tech-jobs`

### 4. Multi-Channel Configuration
The bot now supports both:
- **Single-channel mode**: Legacy support for posting all jobs to one channel
- **Multi-channel mode**: Routes jobs to appropriate forum channels based on category

## Environment Variables Required

### For Multi-Channel Forum Mode:
```bash
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
DISCORD_GUILD_ID=your_guild_id

# Forum Channel IDs
DISCORD_TECH_CHANNEL_ID=channel_id_for_tech_jobs
DISCORD_SALES_CHANNEL_ID=channel_id_for_sales_jobs
DISCORD_MARKETING_CHANNEL_ID=channel_id_for_marketing_jobs
DISCORD_FINANCE_CHANNEL_ID=channel_id_for_finance_jobs
DISCORD_HEALTHCARE_CHANNEL_ID=channel_id_for_healthcare_jobs
DISCORD_PRODUCT_CHANNEL_ID=channel_id_for_product_jobs
DISCORD_SUPPLY_CHANNEL_ID=channel_id_for_supply_chain_jobs
DISCORD_PM_CHANNEL_ID=channel_id_for_project_management_jobs
DISCORD_HR_CHANNEL_ID=channel_id_for_hr_jobs
```

### For Legacy Single-Channel Mode:
```bash
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token
DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID=single_channel_id
```

## Key Features

### Forum Post Format
Each job creates a forum thread with:
- **Thread Title**: `[Company Emoji] Job Title @ Company Name`
- **Embed Content**:
  - Job title with apply link
  - Company name
  - Location
  - Posted date
  - Tags (hashtag format)
  - Job description preview
- **Action Buttons**: Apply button and subscription options
- **Auto-Archive**: After 7 days of inactivity

### Categorization Logic
Jobs are categorized based on keywords in both title and description:
- Checks for role-specific keywords
- Falls back to tech/engineering for unmatched roles
- 96.2% accuracy in testing

### Rate Limiting
- 1.5 seconds between posts in the same channel
- 3 seconds between different channels
- Prevents Discord API rate limiting

## Testing
Created `test-bot-categorization.js` to verify:
- Correct channel routing for different job types
- Emoji handling
- Tag generation

Test results: 25/26 test cases passed (96.2% accuracy)

## Files Modified
1. `.github/scripts/enhanced-discord-bot.js` - Main bot file with all improvements
2. `test-bot-categorization.js` - Test script for verification
3. `work_session_context.md` - Session context documentation
4. `DISCORD_BOT_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - This documentation file

## Next Steps
1. Configure forum channels in Discord server
2. Set up environment variables with channel IDs
3. Create forum tags in each channel for better organization
4. Test with live job postings
5. Monitor for any emoji rendering issues

## Troubleshooting

### If emojis still don't render:
- Check Discord client version
- Verify Unicode support in environment
- Consider using Discord's native emoji codes (`:emoji_name:`)

### If jobs go to wrong channels:
- Review job title and description keywords
- Adjust regex patterns in `getJobChannel()`
- Check channel ID configuration

### If forum posts fail:
- Verify bot has proper permissions (Create Public Threads, Send Messages in Threads)
- Check channel type is actually `GuildForum`
- Ensure thread name is under 100 characters
