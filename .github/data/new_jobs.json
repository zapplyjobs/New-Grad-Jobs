Cosmological research within CPAC covers theory, modeling, observations, and experiments targeted at dark energy, dark matter, primordial fluctuations, inflation, and neutrinos. Theory and modeling activities emphasize multi-wavelength survey science, the galaxy-halo connection, cluster cosmology, and large-scale cosmological simulations. Analysis efforts cover topics such as CMB power spectra, CMB lensing, galaxy clustering, redshift-space distortions, weak/strong gravitational lensing, and artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML). The observational focus is on optical sky surveys (DES, DESI, Roman, Rubin Obs/LSST, DESC, SPHEREx), CMB instrumentation and observations (SPT), and cross-correlations between the two. Applicants with research experience in any of the above areas will be considered. One of our open positions is to work on AI/ML with applications to cosmological modeling and surveys. Another open position is to work with Matthew R. Becker on weak gravitational lensing analysis with Rubin LSST data.
