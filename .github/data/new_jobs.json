    "job_description": "Who We Are Citizen Health was founded on the belief — shaped by firsthand lived experiences navigating healthcare — that having the right advocate is the single most important factor in achieving better care and outcomes. By uniquely combining data, AI, and community, Citizen is building a personalized AI advocate powered by patients' complete medical histories and data from thousands of other patients to generate personalized insights for clinical decisions and day-to-day challenges. Starting in rare and complex conditions, patients share their data in exchange for value, enabling biopharma and researchers with seamless access to patients and regulatory-grade data, shaving years off drug development for much-needed treatments. Citizen is founded by experienced entrepreneurs with multiple successes under their belts and is funded by top-tier investors including 8VC, Transformation Capital, and Headline Ventures, among others. We are a mission-driven team excited to be building the future of consumer healthcare. The Role We're seeking a full-stack Software Engineer to work on the development of our patient, partner, and company web applications. This role is crucial in creating intuitive, efficient, and responsive user interfaces that will directly impact our users' experience and our platform's success. As a key part of our engineering team, you will build high-performance, scalable, and accessible user interfaces that use AI to serve diverse user groups including rare disease patients, healthcare providers, researchers, and our internal teams. You will join a team that highly leverages the latest AI coding assistants (e.g. Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, etc.) to implement features at very high velocity. Your work will be at the heart of our mission, translating complex health data and research findings into user-friendly interfaces that empower patients, facilitate groundbreaking research, and streamline our internal operations. Who you are You’re a builder and problem-solver who thrives in fast-paced, innovative environments. You’ve worked on consumer or data-rich products, enjoy end-to-end ownership, and collaborate closely with teammates to ship real value. You’re comfortable diving into your strengths (frontend, backend, or full-stack) and curious about how AI can improve the experiences we deliver for patients, providers, researchers, and internal teams. You will likely be a fit if you have 0-3 years of professional software engineering experience with a track record of launching user-facing features or services. Strength in one or more of the following: Frontend: JavaScript/TypeScript with a modern framework (e.g., React/Vue), semantic HTML/CSS, accessibility, and performance for data-heavy UIs. Product Engineering: Strong product sense and UX instincts; you use user needs, data, and experiments to guide decisions and iterate quickly. Working knowledge of performance, scalability, and security fundamentals appropriate to your layer (e.g., web perf, API efficiency, data modeling, auth). Experience with testing (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress, PyTest) and comfort with code reviews and iterative development. You will receive bonus points if you have Experience with frontend state management (e.g., Redux, MobX, Recoil) or a backend framework (e.g., Express, FastAPI, Spring, Fiber). Familiarity with CI/CD pipelines and modern build tooling. Proficiency with databases (SQL or NoSQL) and writing simple queries to inform product decisions. Experience with analytics/experimentation and/or accessibility best practices. Exposure to cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP/Azure), containers, and observability is a plus. Why Join Us? At Citizen Health, you will be part of an ambitious mission to build innovative AI-driven solutions that redefine the consumer healthcare experience and improve outcomes for millions. We value curiosity, creativity, and collaboration, and we believe in empowering every team member to have an impact. Here, you’ll find: The chance to work on pioneering AI technologies and solve complex problems that push the boundaries of what’s possible in healthcare The freedom to lead your projects and shape the company’s direction in a mission-driven environment where your work makes a real impact A fast-paced, high-growth setting that brings expanding opportunities and clear paths for career progression A supportive culture of learning, experimentation, and innovation, where new ideas are encouraged and explored A commitment to empathy and diversity, recognizing that our greatest strengths come from our varied perspectives and experiences Regular team activities and knowledge sharing, all within a culture that prioritizes well-being and connection Additional Perks Competitive salary + equity package Comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance Unlimited paid time off, including a generous parental leave Flexible hybrid work environment Our Commitment to Diversity &amp; Inclusion: Citizen Health is proud to be an equal opportunity employer.
