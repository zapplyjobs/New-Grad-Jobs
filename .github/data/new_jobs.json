Base salary range for this role is $115,000 to $155,000 per year based on a full-time schedule and the compensation package will include equity.

These factors include, but are not limited to, job related knowledge and skill set, depth of experience, certifications, degrees, licensures, and specific work location.More About Amae: 'Amae', pronounced ‘Ah-mai’, is a Japanese concept meaning the need to be in good favor with, and the ability to depend on, the people around oneself. It reflects our core belief that a strong support system is essential to build people up, strengthen their will to carry on and even to thrive in life. This mentality applies across our whole company – from the patients we serve to the team we’re building. We’re a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) that provides outpatient psychiatric and primary care health services through value-based care arrangements. Our model’s success is predicated upon achieving outcomes for our patients, not on the volume of services provided.
