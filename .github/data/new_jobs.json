The CFN mission is advancing nanoscience through frontier fundamental research and technique development and is the nexus of a broad collaboration network. Each year, CFN staff members support the research of nearly 600 external facility users.Three strategic nanoscience themes underlie the CFN scientific facilities: The CFN conducts research on nanomaterial synthesis by assembly designing precise architectures with targeted functionality by organizing nanoscale components. The CFN researches and applies platforms for state-of-the-art techniques for Accelerated Nanomaterial Discovery, integrating synthesis, advanced characterization, physical modeling, and computer science to iteratively explore a wide range of material parameters. The CFN develops and utilizes advanced capabilities for studies of Nanomaterials in Operando Conditions for characterizing materials and reactions at the atomic scale in real-world environments.The CFN is seeking an exceptional Postdoctoral Research Associate to conduct research directed towards the production of fuels & products from partial oxidation of hydrocarbons on copper based catalysts. Coinage metals are used in the industry for a number of catalytic reactions, but due to the facility of their compounds to rapidly change oxidation, in particular for copper, there is no agreement about their active phase and related reaction mechanisms, and thus no clear path about how to realize their full potential.
