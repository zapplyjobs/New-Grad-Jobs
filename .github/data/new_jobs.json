By uniquely combining data, AI, and community, Citizen is building a personalized AI advocate powered by patients' complete medical histories and data from thousands of other patients to generate personalized insights for clinical decisions and day-to-day challenges.

As a key part of our engineering team, you will build high-performance, scalable, and accessible user interfaces that use AI to serve diverse user groups including rare disease patients, healthcare providers, researchers, and our internal teams. You will join a team that highly leverages the latest AI coding assistants (e.g. Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, etc.) to implement features at very high velocity.

Who you are You’re a builder and problem-solver who thrives in fast-paced, innovative environments. You’ve worked on consumer or data-rich products, enjoy end-to-end ownership, and collaborate closely with teammates to ship real value. You’re comfortable diving into your strengths (frontend, backend, or full-stack) and curious about how AI can improve the experiences we deliver for patients, providers, researchers, and internal teams. You will likely be a fit if you have 0-3 years of professional software engineering experience with a track record of launching user-facing features or services. Strength in one or more of the following: Frontend: JavaScript/TypeScript with a modern framework (e.g., React/Vue), semantic HTML/CSS, accessibility, and performance for data-heavy UIs.

Working knowledge of performance, scalability, and security fundamentals appropriate to your layer (e.g., web perf, API efficiency, data modeling, auth). Experience with testing (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress, PyTest) and comfort with code reviews and iterative development. You will receive bonus points if you have Experience with frontend state management (e.g., Redux, MobX, Recoil) or a backend framework (e.g., Express, FastAPI, Spring, Fiber). Familiarity with CI/CD pipelines and modern build tooling. Proficiency with databases (SQL or NoSQL) and writing simple queries to inform product decisions. Experience with analytics/experimentation and/or accessibility best practices. Exposure to cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP/Azure), containers, and observability is a plus. Why Join Us?
