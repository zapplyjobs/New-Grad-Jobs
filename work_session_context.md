# Work Session Context - Discord Bot Improvements

## Session Recovered After PC Crash

### Current Task Overview
Working on fixing and improving the Discord bot for the New-Grad-Positions repository.

### Key Context Points
1. **Initial Approach**: Started with a separate bot setup but decided to modify the existing bot for simplicity and safety
2. **Main Issues to Fix**:
   - Emoji handling errors (see Job_Emoji_Error.png)
   - Change posting structure from messages to forum posts

3. **Desired Changes**:
   - **FROM**: Jobs posted as messages in a single channel
   - **TO**: Jobs posted as individual posts/threads in forum channels
   - **Target Channels**: See Channels_Target.png for the forum channels structure
   - **Post UI Reference**: See Posts.png for desired post appearance

### Work Methodology
1. Always discuss changes before implementing
2. Review what has changed compared to last pushed branch
3. Fix existing issues systematically
4. Test changes incrementally
5. Maintain backwards compatibility where possible

### Files Being Modified
- Main bot file: `.github/scripts/enhanced-discord-bot.js`
- Possibly related: `.github/scripts/improved-discord-bot.js` (new file, may be experimental)
- Setup documentation: `.github/scripts/IMPROVED-BOT-SETUP.md`

### Next Steps
1. Review changes made vs last pushed version
2. Analyze the emoji error issue
3. Implement forum channel posting
4. Test the solution
