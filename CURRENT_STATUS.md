# Current Status - Discord Bot Project

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-04

## ✅ What's Working

1. **Discord bot connects successfully**
   - Logs show: "Enhanced Discord bot logged in as Zapply Jobs Bot#9522"

2. **Job detection works**
   - Bot correctly identifies jobs in new_jobs.json
   - Counts posted vs unposted jobs

3. **Logging system operational**
   - Saves detailed logs to `.github/logs/`
   - Shows in workflow output

4. **Test workflow created**
   - Dedicated workflow for testing Discord posting
   - Doesn't interfere with main job fetcher

## 🔧 Recent Fixes

1. **Multi-channel detection bug** (JUST FIXED)
   - Empty env vars were triggering multi-channel mode
   - Now correctly falls back to single-channel

2. **2-second kill timer** (FIXED)
   - Bot was being killed before posting
   - Now waits for completion

3. **Channel fetching** (FIXED)
   - Changed from unreliable cache to fetch()

## ⚠️ Known Issues

1. **Job fetcher overwrites new_jobs.json**
   - Any manual test jobs get wiped
   - Workaround: Use test workflow

2. **Missing GitHub Secrets**
   - `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` not set
   - `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` not set
   - Multi-channel IDs not set (but not needed for single-channel)

## 📊 Latest Test Results

From workflow run #1:
```
✅ Bot logged in
✅ Found 3 test jobs
❌ Jobs skipped due to multi-channel false positive
```

Expected after fix:
```
✅ Bot logged in
✅ Found 3 test jobs
✅ Posts to single channel
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Push the multi-channel fix**
   ```bash
   git add .github/scripts/enhanced-discord-bot.js
   git commit -m "Fix multi-channel detection bug"
   git push
   ```

2. **Run test workflow again**
   - Should post to single channel now

3. **If working, add multi-channel IDs**
   - Add to GitHub Secrets
   - Test multi-channel routing

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `.github/scripts/enhanced-discord-bot.js` | Main bot | ✅ Fixed |
| `.github/scripts/save-discord-logs.js` | Logging wrapper | ✅ Working |
| `.github/workflows/test-discord-bot.yml` | Test workflow | ✅ Working |
| `.github/workflows/update-jobs.yml` | Main workflow | ⚠️ Overwrites test jobs |

## 🔐 Environment Variables

### Currently Set:
- ✅ `DISCORD_TOKEN`
- ✅ `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID`

### Not Set (Optional):
- ❌ `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`
- ❌ `DISCORD_GUILD_ID`
- ❌ All multi-channel IDs

## 📝 Test Data

Test jobs use format:
- ID: `test-{company}-{role}-{location}-{run_number}`
- Example: `test-meta-swe-sf-1`

This prevents conflicts with real job IDs.

## 🚀 Quick Commands

```bash
# Run test workflow
gh workflow run test-discord-bot.yml

# Check logs
git pull
cat .github/logs/latest.log

# See test job status
cat .github/data/new_jobs.json | jq length

# Clean test IDs
node -e "/* script to remove test- IDs */"
```
