## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Add Discord Channel IDs to GitHub Secrets

**IMPORTANT:** Get the actual channel IDs from your Discord server first.

**How to get Discord Channel IDs:**
1. Enable Developer Mode in Discord: User Settings ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Developer Mode
2. Right-click each channel ‚Üí Copy Channel ID
3. Save these IDs securely (don't commit them anywhere!)

**Add to GitHub Secrets:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/zapplyjobs/New-Grad-Jobs/settings/secrets/actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Add each of these secrets with your actual channel IDs:

| Secret Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `DISCORD_REMOTE_USA_CHANNEL_ID` | Remote USA jobs channel ID |
| `DISCORD_NY_CHANNEL_ID` | New York channel ID |
| `DISCORD_AUSTIN_CHANNEL_ID` | Austin channel ID |
| `DISCORD_CHICAGO_CHANNEL_ID` | Chicago channel ID |
| `DISCORD_SEATTLE_CHANNEL_ID` | Seattle channel ID |
| `DISCORD_REDMOND_CHANNEL_ID` | Redmond channel ID |
| `DISCORD_MV_CHANNEL_ID` | Mountain View channel ID |
| `DISCORD_SF_CHANNEL_ID` | San Francisco channel ID |
| `DISCORD_SUNNYVALE_CHANNEL_ID` | Sunnyvale channel ID |
| `DISCORD_SAN_BRUNO_CHANNEL_ID` | San Bruno channel ID |

---

### Step 2: Commit and Push Changes

```bash
cd /c/Users/jarra/Videos/Work/Business/New-Grad-Positions

# Verify ONLY code changes (no sensitive data)
git diff

# Stage the changes
git add .github/scripts/enhanced-discord-bot.js
git add .github/workflows/test-discord-bot.yml
git add .github/workflows/update-jobs.yml
git add README.md

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: Add location-based job posting

- Jobs now post to BOTH industry AND location channels
- Added 10 location-specific channels
- Modified bot to detect job locations
- Added Locations badge to README

Max 2 posts per job (1 industry + 1 location)
Duplicate prevention unchanged"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

---

### Step 3: Test with GitHub Actions

1. **Go to:** https://github.com/zapplyjobs/New-Grad-Jobs/actions/workflows/test-discord-bot.yml
2. **Click:** "Run workflow"
3. **Configure:**
   - Number of test jobs: `3`
   - Skip posted check: ‚úÖ Enable
4. **Click:** "Run workflow" (green button)
5. **Monitor:** Watch logs for dual posting messages

---

### Step 4: Verify in Discord

Check that test jobs appear in:

**Industry Channels:**
- `#tech-jobs`
- `#sales-jobs`

**Location Channels:**
- `#san-francisco`
- `#mountain-view`
- `#new-york`

**Expected:** Each test job appears in exactly 2 channels (1 industry + 1 location)

---

## How It Works

### Dual Posting Flow

```
New Job
  ‚Üì
Check if already posted
  ‚Üì
Not Posted ‚Üí Continue
  ‚Üì
Determine Industry Channel (tech, sales, etc.)
  ‚Üì
Determine Location Channel (SF, NYC, etc.)
  ‚Üì
Post to Industry Channel ‚úÖ
  ‚Üì
[1.5s delay]
  ‚Üì
Post to Location Channel ‚úÖ (if location matches)
  ‚Üì
Mark as Posted
```

### Duplicate Prevention

- Job ID generated from company + title + location
- Checked BEFORE posting
- Marked as posted AFTER successful post
- Next run: Job ID exists ‚Üí skips BOTH channels
- **Maximum 2 posts per job total**

---

## Location Detection

The bot detects locations using this priority order:

1. **Remote USA jobs:** Must mention both "remote" AND "USA"
2. **Exact city match:** In `job_city` field
3. **City in title/description:** Searches for city keywords

**Covered locations:**
- Remote USA
- New York, San Francisco, Austin, Chicago
- Seattle, Redmond, Mountain View, Sunnyvale, San Bruno

**Jobs without matching locations:** Posted to industry channel only (1 post)

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

### Quick Disable (No Code Changes)

1. Delete location channel IDs from GitHub Secrets
2. Bot automatically detects no location channels
3. Returns to industry-only posting

### Code Revert

```bash
git log --oneline | head -5  # Find commit hash
git revert <commit-hash>
git push
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### No location posts appearing

**Check:**
- Are channel IDs added to GitHub Secrets?
- Do workflow logs show location posting attempts?
- Does bot have permissions in location channels?

### Duplicate posts (more than 2)

**Check:**
- Verify `posted_jobs.json` contains job IDs
- Check for duplicate detection errors in logs

### Only industry OR location (not both)

**Check:**
- Workflow logs for error messages
- Look for channel fetch failures
- Verify channel permissions

---

## Security Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Keep channel IDs in GitHub Secrets
- Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- Review code before committing
- Use placeholders in documentation

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Commit channel IDs to repository
- Include tokens/keys in code
- Push sensitive data to public repos
- Share secrets in chat/email
